### Step 3: Email Delivery Issue
The problem is that actual email sending is disabled for security reasons.

## 🚀 Solutions to Enable Email Delivery

### Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Recommended)
1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. **Update server.js**:
   ```javascript
   const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
       service: 'gmail',
       auth: {
           user: 'your-gmail@gmail.com',
           pass: 'your-16-digit-app-password'
       }
   });
   ```
4. **Uncomment email sending**:
   ```javascript
   await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
   ```

### Option 2: Formspree (Easiest)
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Create free account
3. Create new form
4. Replace form action in index.html:

   <form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```

### Option 3: EmailJS (Client-side)
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
