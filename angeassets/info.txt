Weekly Yoga classes for wellbeing in Troon, Irvine and Kilwinning with 200 YTT Yoga Teacher Ange Dickson

Our Yoga classes have been established for nearly 7 years in Ayrshire. We blend the styles of hatha, yin and ashtanga Yoga and classes are friendly, relaxing and suitable for beginners and returners to your practice. Our aims are to build resilience, flexibility, confidence and boost overall wellbeing. We include asanas (postures), pranayama (yogic breathing techniques), mindfulness & meditation, poetry and inspiring quotes. We also offer a deeply restoring Bedtime Yoga & Sound Bath experience once a month in Kilwinning and Barassie Beach Yoga when weather permits on Wednesdays at 7pm and Saturdays at 9am. Why not also try our annual Wellness Weekend Retreat in Ayrshire, incorporating Yoga and mindfulness. Some of our weekly classes are still also offered on Zoom if you can't make it in-person to a class. We run tailored workshops and events for corporate and charity organisations. We also offer foot treatments in Irvine as Reflexology 71 with Ange and we look forward to welcoming you soon. Namaste. Ange
